> setup & start Laravel from downloaded zip file
Once Composer is installed, download the 4.2 version of the Laravel framework and extract its contents into a directory on your server. Next, in the root of your Laravel application, run the php composer.phar install (or composer install) command to install all of the framework's dependencies. This process requires Git to be installed on the server to successfully complete the installation.

If you want to update the Laravel framework, you may issue the php composer.phar update command.
